	(b) User gets a 6 digit number and a countdown timer 
	(c) User hands their device or reads out the number to someone at a terminal
	(d) Page on user device automatically reloads and notes the number of points added to their account
	
	Future state:
	    (1) Some sort of QR code or image recognition for something closer to a "scan"
	    (2) Remove / dispute transactions functionality

    (2) Point consumption
	(a) Uesr hits the "User Points" link / button
	(b) User gets a 6 digit number and a countdown timer
	(c) User hands their device or reads out the number at a terminal
	(d) Page on user device automatically reloads and notes the number of points removed from their account
